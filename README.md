# SC-Atlanta-2018
Supplementary Materials for "AAA on an Indie Budget - Building Your Own CRM From Common Household Parts"

Welcome SourceCon attendees! You're probably here because you attended (or wanted to) my talk at SourceCon Fall 2018, in Atlanta Georgia.

If not, or if it's been a while, I created this basic CRM as learning and teaching project. ???

The CRM is pretty basic right now, but 

I've included a copy of the slide deck [here](/AAA%20on%20an%20Indie%20Budget%20-%20Dave%20Galley%20-%20SC18F.pptx).

You probably won't need any of the files in the HTML Templates or gs folders, but I've included them anyway.
