Welcome SourceCon attendees! You're probably here because you attended (or wanted to) my talk at SourceCon Fall 2018, in Atlanta Georgia. I've included a copy of the slide deck [here](/AAA%20on%20an%20Indie%20Budget%20-%20Dave%20Galley%20-%20SC18F.pptx).

If not, or if it's been a while, I created this basic CRM as both an instructional aide and learning project. Being able to whip up simple (or not so simple) tools to help manage your workload or gather and process large amounts of online data is becoming an increasingly important skillset for the modern Sourcer. My hope is you'll join me in learning just enough about coding to start building your own!

To get started, click on over to the [walkthrough](/Installation%20and%20Setup%20Guide.md) I made for installing and setting up the model version of my CRM. The guide's got step-by-step install and setup instructions, including screenshots for each step. Hopefully it'll be easy to follow.

The model CRM itself is pretty basic, with just enough working parts to be better than a cloud of Post-it&reg; notes tacked to your monitor. I'm dog-fooding this sucker right now as motivation to come back and improve and add to it. Of course, I'll be sharing those here as well. Feel free to submit bugs/feature requests/suggestions for improvement via the Issues tracker.

The files in the `HTML Templates` and `gs` folders are already baked into a Google Spreadsheet, but I've included them here for ease of review. Be warned, my code is kludgey, poorly document, and just generally terrible. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` I'm largely self-taught, and have shamelessly copied and pasted bits and pieces from dozens of StackOverflow answers and Google help docs to get this model into working order. Don't be afraid to do the same as  you continue to play around and learn!

Questions? Having trouble making it work? Just wanna talk shop? Feel free to ping (or follow for that matter) me on:
